👋 Hi, I’m @carmacs

👀 I’m interested in innovation, Python programming, and investing in various assets such as stocks, funds, ETFs, derivatives (mostly options), and crypto or blockchain-related products.

🌱 I’m currently learning about advanced data analysis techniques in Python to enhance my investment strategies.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source Python projects related to finance and data analysis.
